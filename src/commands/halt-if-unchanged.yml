  Halts redundant CI runs if watched directories are unchanged

parameters:
  watch:
    description: "Directories to watch for changes, separated by spaces"
    type: string
    default: ""

# We use CIRCLE_COMPARE_URL to halt redundant jobs
# Saving you time, and in turn TONS in runtime costs
# To make this happen, we need this orb to construct the URL
# (there are outstanding issues with the URL being blank, circa Q1 2019)
# https://github.com/iynere/compare-url
steps:
  - compare-url/reconstruct
  - run:
      # https://github.com/iynere/compare-url#command-example
      name: "runtime-optimizer: Halt if watch files unchanged"
      command: |
        # Load the compare URL, since this is a fresh shell
        CIRCLE_COMPARE_URL=$(cat CIRCLE_COMPARE_URL.txt)
        # Run the check-changes script
        cd ~/repo
        sh .circleci/check-changes.sh "${CIRCLE_COMPARE_URL}" ".circleci << parameters.watch >>" || circleci step halt
