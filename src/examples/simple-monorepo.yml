  Simple Example: a monorepo containing "/client" and "/server"
  recently had changes to the client, but not the server
  runtime-optimizer/checkout-with-cache - optimizes repeat runs
  runtime-optimizer/halt-if-unchanged - halts (passes) server runs
  because only the client side has changed - making server specs redundant
  PEER DEPENDENCY: iynere/compare-url - to ensure $CIRCLE_COMPARE_URL is made

usage:
  version: 2.1

  orbs:
    runtime-optimizer: rckeller/runtime-optimizer@x.y.z
    # PEER DEPENDENCY: Ensure CIRCLE_COMPARE_URL exists
    compare-url: iynere/compare-url@1.0.0

        - run:

            command: exit 0 # In this example, should be reached
